The dynamics and movement between the musicians and performers on stage and the various corners of the venue were essential. Thus, different seating areas with a particular function were created: a formal dining area stretches down the entire left wall, while an elongated bar takes over the entire facing wall. In the center, low-seating allows customers to enjoy the stage performance more intently, while high tables further back, integrated within the library racks, caters for side conversations. Finally, “love-bird cages”, surrounded with greenery, offer a more cocooned intimacy & sensual experience, while maintaining an unobstructed view of the entire floor.",

A wooden walnut staircase gracefully ascends, paving the way to the mezzanine level that blends natural textures and warm tones, and invites for exploration.",

The salon seamlessly merges with an open African walnut wooden kitchen, boasting a quartz countertop that gives warmth to the space, creating an inviting space for cooking and socializing. The adjacent terrace, treated with the same materials as the interior, blurs the boundaries between indoors and outdoors, and provides an extension of the living space with a seamless connection to the surrounding environment.",

This elevated vantage point gives the impression of being nestled on top of a tree overlooking the bustling cityscape while providing a tranquil retreat where one can appreciate the loft's architecture and absorb the captivating urban landscape. A large glass window in the master bedroom, serves as a captivating frame for observing the view allowing the panorama to become an integral part of the bedroom's ambiance.",

      "Since 2017, we experimented with Venetian glassblowers on the island of Murano diverse techniques to achieve new textures in glass; we sourced various types of metal waste from surrounding factories and infused them within glass. The process consists of working with metals in different states - powder, molten and chunks - and reacting them through different calibers of temperature within the glass. The experiments result in a wide array of extra-terrestrial formations between the two materials. The attained lava-stone textures allow light to filter through the transluscent glass-metal material.",
      "Conjuring textures of excavated eroded artefacts, we were drawn to the rich history of glassblowing to determine the forms of this new collection. Made in Murano, the material’s epicentre of craft, we drew connections and shared knowledge of glass-making between the Venetian lagoon and our own heritage, across the Mediterranean region, and Ancient Egypt to Lebanon. The most common legend around the first discovery of glass, dating to the Phoenicians (1500-300 BC), notes the fusion of certain metals and sand to birth a new material. Production sites were found in Mesopotamia, modern day Egypt and Syria, and reach as far as the Mediterranean in the Hellenistic age (400-100 BC).",
      "Bearing resemblance to archaeological cinerary urns, unguentarium and other glass-blown objects placed in tombs as offerings in Ancient times, ’Jurat’ addresses the value of time on objects. The vessels playfully conjure the illusion of time travel presenting as objects excavated from another century but their contemporaneity is visible through their form and texture on closer inspection. Once mouth-blown to form, each unique 'Jurat' vessel underwent several distorting techniques including pinching, flattening, poking, and compressing.",
